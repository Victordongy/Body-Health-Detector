# Body-Health-Detector
What if we could detect the overall health performance instead of just recording the action activity

## Insights
I am a Iphone user and also a tech product addictor, so I always check out the application on the store. However, as more and more 
applications claim to be good detector for our walking step everyday, few of them could detect if we are running or standing still. And 
none of them, as far as I have known, could detect the body status according to the data above only the human activity but also the sounds
or the vibration frequency during different circumstances. 

Therefore, I would like to establish this training model and prediction system to detect the overall body status and further the body health
status, which would be awesome for the olds and the youngs and the people who want to check out their stress health from the sleep characteristics
without bothering to input in the mobile application their sleep-in time and sleep-out time.
